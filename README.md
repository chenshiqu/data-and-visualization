We are interested in how federal, non-military employment was impacted by the transition from
president George Bush to president Barack Obama to learn about the impact of the difference in policy
between the two administrations on the federal government. What agencies increased/decreased
staffing size? What agencies had more or less turnover? Do those changes align with stated policy
goals? Is agency staffing impacted by events?

Describe the meaning and type of data (scale of measurement, values, etc.) for the variables in
the data file(s). [10 point]
• Verify the data quality. Are there missing values? Duplicate data? Outliers? Are those
mistakes? How do you deal with these problems? [10 Points]
• Give simple appropriate statistics (e.g., range, mode, mean, median, variance, counts) for each
variable and describe what they mean, especially, if you found something interesting. Note:
You can also use data from other sources for comparison. [10 points]
• Visualize the most important variables appropriately (at least 5 attributes). Important: Provide
an interpretation for each chart and explain for each variable why you chose the used
visualization. Charts without explanation are useless! [20 points]
• Explore relationships between variables with appropriate methods (a minimum of 5
relationships). Use, for example, scatter plots, correlation, boxplots, cross-tabulation, group-
wise averages. [25 points]
• The data contains data for over 40 years and thus has a temporal component. What could you do
by analyzing changes over time? Can you do some if this (exceptional work)? [5 points]
